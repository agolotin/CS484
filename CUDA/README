Description:
A very simple Hello World designed to help demonstrate the high parallelism
available in a modern GPU.

Files:
  Exercise:
    hello.cu - the Hello World example

Compile:
Requires a GPU with SM2.0 or greater
Using the NVIDIA C Compiler
  nvcc  -arch=sm_20 -o hello hello.cu

Flow:
1. Compile and run the code. If using a Fermi-class GPU, you should see 
"HELLO WORLD!" printed out with one character per-line, no randomization.
2. Now increase the number of blocks to 2. Ask what the students expect to see.
On a Fermi-class GPU, you will start to see randomization of the letters based
on how the printf mechanism works. At this point describe how many threads are
operating at the exact same time to print these letters out, and how they are
displayed is simply a race condition.
3. If a hands-on lab, let the students play with the number of threads and
blocks.
